# Capstone_Project
Data Science and Machine Learning Capstone Project

This repository contains materials for the Machine Learning Capstone course offered by IBM.

ðŸ“Š Data Science and Machine Learning Capstone Project
---
Welcome to the final project of the Data Science program. In this capstone course, you will apply your skills in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning to solve a real-world problem: predicting whether the first stage of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully.

This challenge reflects a real-world business scenario where this prediction directly impacts the cost of satellite launches and the competitiveness of the aerospace market. Throughout the course, you will work as a Data Scientist for a private space launch company.

ðŸš€ Project Objective
---
Develop a predictive model to determine the likelihood that the first stage of the Falcon 9 will land successfully. This information is critical to assess the feasibility of component reuse and calculate launch costs.

ðŸ§  Skills Applied
---
Throughout this project, you will reinforce key data science skills, including:

Data collection and processing from multiple sources (Web scraping, REST APIs)

Exploratory data analysis using SQL, Pandas, and Matplotlib

Interactive data visualization with Folium and Plotly Dash

Feature engineering

Predictive modeling using classification algorithms

Effective communication of insights through reports and presentations

ðŸ›  Prerequisites
---
To successfully complete this project, you should have completed the following courses:

Python for Data Science Basics

SQL for Data Science

Data Analysis with Python

Data Visualization with Python

Machine Learning with Python

ðŸ“š Course Content
---
The course is structured into five modules:

Data Collection and Processing
Introduction to the project scenario, using Watson Studio and GitHub, obtaining and cleaning data from APIs and scraping.

Exploratory Data Analysis
Statistical analysis and visualization of relationships between variables using SQL and Python libraries.

Interactive Visualization and Dashboards
Using tools like Folium for interactive maps and Plotly Dash to create dashboards.

Predictive Modeling
Building, evaluating, and optimizing classification models to predict outcomes.

Presenting Results
Structuring a report and final presentation to communicate actionable insights based on data.

ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives
---
Apply data science knowledge to a real-world business scenario.

Conduct data analysis and visualization using Python.

Implement machine learning techniques to solve a predictive problem.

Effectively present findings and recommendations based on data.
